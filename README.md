## Introduction

- All translations are for non-commercial purposes, If infringing, I will delete it in a timely manner

- I use the tool(https://converter.app/mp3-to-text/) to translate mp3 to text basically, which is free(You know, I'm so poor)

- Se-radio podcasts are high quality, I only translate these podcasts without a transcript. English is not my native language, the translation process also aids in honing my listening skills.

- I translate these episodes and I hope it will be helpful to you
